# Debugging Workshop

This app is a simple joke generator. You put your name in and it will
automatically generate a joke for you. But OH NO! Our app is full of bugs! It's
up to you to debug this app and get it up and running once more.

The below gif demonstrates the intended functionality of this app:

Your job is to identify the bugs in the `index.js` file, fix them, and get
the application to match the demo.

Watch this video to help refine your debugging process:
